\begin{exercise}
  Consider the knapsack problem
  \begin{equation}
    \max \left\{
      \sum_{j = 1}^{n} c_j x_j :
      \sum_{j = 1}^{n} a_j x_j \leq b,
      0 \leq x \leq 1
    \right\}
  \end{equation}
  where all the data are positive integers.
  Define the knapsack relaxation polytope by
  \begin{equation}
    P = \{
      x \in \R^n :
      \sum_{j = 1}^{n} a_j x_j \leq b,
      0 \leq x \leq 1
    \}.
  \end{equation}
  Assume that the variables have been ordered such that $c_1 / a_1 \geq c_2 / a_2 \geq \cdots \geq c_n / a_n$.
  Try to guess an optimal solution and prove the optimality by considering the dual problem.
  Use this result to characterize all the vertices of $P$.
  What about the cover inequalities in relation to these vertices?
